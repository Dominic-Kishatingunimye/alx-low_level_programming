0-positive_or_negative: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

1-last_digit: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program. The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

2-print_alphabet: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)

3-print_alphabets: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden).

4-print_alphabt: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden).
